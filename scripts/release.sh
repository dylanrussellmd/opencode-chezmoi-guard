# release — cut a version, push it, let GitHub publish to npm.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/release.sh patch    # 1.0.1 → 1.0.2
#   ./scripts/release.sh minor    # 1.0.1 → 1.1.0
#   ./scripts/release.sh major    # 1.0.1 → 2.0.0
#   ./scripts/release.sh 1.5.0    # explicit version
#
# What it does:
#   1. Refuses if the work tree is dirty or main isn't in sync with origin.
#   2. Runs `npm version <bump>` — this bumps package.json AND, via the
#      `version` lifecycle hook (scripts/sync-version.mjs), rewrites
#      src/version.ts to match, then commits both in one commit named
#      "<new-version>" and tags it vX.Y.Z.
#   3. Pushes main + the new tag to origin.
#   4. The Release workflow picks up the tag, runs the full gate, and
#      publishes to npm via OIDC Trusted Publishing. You do nothing else.
#
# You never run `npm publish` or touch an npm token. The only npm command
# invoked is `npm version` (a local file-edit + git-commit helper).
